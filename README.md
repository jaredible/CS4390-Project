# Categorizing Facial Expressions with Deep Learning

## About the Project

The overall goal of this project was to learn the foundations of deep learning. Specifically, how to use TensorFlow/Keras to build, train, and evaluate CNNs (convolutional neural networks) on an image dataset.

*I regret not committing changes to this repo regularly so that I could reminisce.*
